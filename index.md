* Option to select which way to get item stats (WoW API - GetItemStats or parse from tooltip).

Others still use WoW API call.

## v1.4.1 - 15 Mar 2015
* Added Avoidance stat
* Bugfixes

## v1.4 - 28 Feb 2015
* Total weighted stat score of all equipped items is now calculated and displayed on character stats pane (this can be disabled in options by unchecking **Show total score**)
* By default, the percentage difference in score is now calculated against total score, rather than equipped item. This better shows you how big of an upgrade an item is. _(For example an item that is (+50 +20%) better than current item adds less score than an item that is (+100 +10%), even though the percentage is bigger and that can be misleading. Comparison against total score would show something like (+50 +1%) and (+100 +2%))_. If you preferred the way it was before, you can change it in options by selecting **Compare percentage gain to** - Equipped item score.
* You can now select whether to display percentage as change or difference (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change_and_difference). See **Calculate percentage as** in options.
* Two handed weapons are now compared to Main hand + Offhand score
